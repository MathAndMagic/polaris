# StarfleetAI Polaris LLM

Polaris is a family of large language models developed by StarfleetAI, intended for use in autonomous AI agent scenarios.

It comes in several sizes:

- [Small](./small)
- ... and some others one day :)

## Target models characteristics

1. Good at code (Python, in a first place)
2. Decent context window (8k+)
3. Low hallucination rate ("it's better to give up, instead of making up")
4. Ability to call functions
5. Good with relative dates ("Schedule a meeting at 6PM tomorrow")
5. Pretty formatted outputs (nice typography, correct markdown)
6. Multimodality
7. Works well when quantized to 8bit (4bit is a target as well, but not for the `small` version)

There is a long way to go before we achieve all of these, but when we eventually do, the models can become solid foundations for building autonomous AI agents.
